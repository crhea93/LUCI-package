Basic Example Lite
==================

This example is the much condensed version of our basic example for those of us
already familiar with the parameters and how `LUCI` works. Let's get started!

Let's start with importing `LUCI`. Just as descsribed on the *readthedocs* page, we need to point our system path to our install location of the **LUCI** folder.
We will additionally import the Luci plotting functions :)

.. code-block::python

# Imports
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/media/carterrhea/carterrhea/SIGNALS/LUCI/')  # Location of Luci
from LuciBase import Luci
import LUCI.LuciPlotting as lplt

We now will set the required parameters. We are also going to be using our machine learning algorithm to get the initial guesses.

.. code-block::python

#Set Parameters
# Using Machine Learning Algorithm for Initial Guess
cube_dir = '/media/carterrhea/carterrhea/Benjamin'  # Path to data cube
cube_name = 'A0426_SN3.merged.cm1.1.0'  # don't add .hdf5 extension
object_name = 'NGC1275'
redshift = 0.017284  # Redshift of NGC 1275
ML_ref = '/media/carterrhea/carterrhea/SIGNALS/LUCI/ML/Reference-Spectrum-R1800'
ML_model = '/media/carterrhea/carterrhea/SIGNALS/LUCI/ML/R1800-PREDICTOR-I'

We intialize our LUCI object

.. code-block:: python

# Create Luci object
cube = Luci(cube_dir+'/'+cube_name, cube_dir, object_name, redshift, ML_ref, ML_model)

The output will look something like this:
